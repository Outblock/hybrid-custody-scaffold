This scaffold was created to make starting a Hybrid Custody project easier for you, and is a simplified template of the contents of [@Flowtyio/restricted-child-account](https://github.com/Flowtyio/restricted-child-account)

## üî® Getting started

Getting started can feel overwhelming, but we are here for you. Depending on how accustomed you are to Flow, here's a list of resources you might find useful:

- [Cadence documentation](https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language): here you will find language reference for Cadence, which will be the language in which you develop your smart contracts,
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=DX_841432) and [Cadence extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onflow.cadence): we suggest using Visual Studio Code IDE for writing Cadence with the Cadence extension installed, that will give you nice syntax highlitning and additional smart features,
- [SDKs](https://developers.flow.com/tools#sdks): here you will find a list of SDKs you can use to ease the interaction with Flow network (sending transactions, fetching accounts etc),
- [Tools](https://developers.flow.com/tools#development-tools): development tools you can use to make your development easier, 

**NFT Resources:**

- [flow-nft](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft): home of the Flow NFT standards, contains utility contracts, examples, and documentation,
- [nft-storefront](https://github.com/onflow/nft-storefront/): NFT Storefront is an open marketplace contract used by most Flow NFT marketplaces,
- [Flow NFT Catalog](https://www.flow-nft-catalog.com/): list of NFT contracts on Flow, can be a valuable source to compose new projects or use as example,

## üì¶ Project Structure

Your project comes with some standard folders which have a special purpose:

- `/cadence` inside here is where your Cadence smart contracts code lives
- `flow.json` configuration file for your project, you can think of it as package.json, but you don't need to worry, flow dev command will configure it for you

Inside `cadence` folder you will find:

- `/contracts` location for Cadence contracts go in this folder
- `/scripts` location for Cadence scripts goes here
- `/transactions` location for Cadence transactions goes in this folder

## ü§î What is Hybrid Custody?

## üë®‚Äçüíª Start Developing

[Install Flow CLI](https://developers.flow.com/tooling/flow-cli/install)

From your workspace directory, setup your Flow project from a scaffold

    ```sh
    flow setup <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> --scaffold
    ```

You'll be asked to select the scaffold number for this scaffold
    
```sh
‚úó Enter the scaffold number:
```
    
Go ahead and enter the scaffold number for Hybrid Custody Project: `[4] Hybrid Custody Project` [TODO - confirm scaffold number after flow-cli PR]

```sh
‚úî Enter the scaffold number: 4
```

Now, to get emulator running and deploy contracts. Change to your project's directory
    
```sh
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

Run the emulator
    
```sh
flow emulator --contracts
```

> :information_source: We use --contracts flag to include additional contracts we can then easily import into our project.

Deploy the scaffold project contracts
    
```sh
flow deploy
```

You now have a running emulator instance with all project contracts deployed to `emulator-account`. We know this is the
account where contracts were deployed because of our `deployments` field in our [flow.json](./flow.json) file:

```json
{   // ...
    "deployments": {
		"emulator": {
            // **NOTE:** These contracts are not deployed to a single contract on testnet/mainnet, but are done so
            //           here for the sake of simplicity. Refer to contract aliases for contract deployment addresses.
			"emulator-account": [
				"AddressUtils",
				"StringUtils",
				"ArrayUtils",
				"HybridCustody",
				"CapabilityProxy",
				"CapabilityFilter",
				"CapabilityFactory",
				"FTProviderFactory",
				"NFTProviderFactory",
				"NFTProviderAndCollectionFactory",
				"NFTCollectionPublicFactory",
				"ExampleToken"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

## üèéÔ∏è Interacting with HybridCustody

Now that the project contracts are deployed on a locally running emulator instance, we can start to interact with them. Let's check out a ***progressive onboarding*** flow.

What is ***progressive onboarding***? It's the process of onboarding a new-to-Web3 user on to your application, abstracting away onchain interactions, and on through to Hybrid Custody once they link their accounts

### Create Dev Account

### Walletless Onboarding

### Create Parent Account

### Link Parent & Child Accounts

### Inspect Account Storage

### Bonus: Blockchain-Native Onboarding
